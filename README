DESCRIPTION:

A simple wallet microservice running on the JVM that manages credit/debit transactions on behalf of players.
A monetary account holds the current balance for a player. The balance can be modified by registering transactions on the account, either debit
transactions (removing funds) or credit transactions (adding funds).

It is based on a programming challenge found on the internet, and meant to be used for educational purposes only.

An Angular frontend for it is available on  https://github.com/malandrakisgeo/micro-frontend  .

BEFORE YOU BEGIN:

HOW TO RUN:
Just run the program in any Java IDE. It was made with IntelliJ, and it should not be a problem to run it on e.g. NetBeans or Eclipse.

The default url of the backend is http://localhost:8080/.
The frontend is supposed to send requests from http://localhost:4200.
